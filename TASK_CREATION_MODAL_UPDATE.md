# Task Creation Modal Update

## Overview
Replaced the inline task creation form with a modern modal dialog that supports workflow-specific fields.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modal Design
- **Moved from inline Card to Modal** - Uses fixed overlay with centered modal (similar to Guide Task modal)
- **Workflow Selection** - Visual card-based selector with icons for each workflow type
- **Responsive Layout** - Max width 2xl, max height 90vh with scroll support
- **Sticky Header** - Header stays visible when scrolling through long forms

### 2. Workflow-Specific Fields

#### **Proactive Workflow** (Purple)
- Icon: âš¡ Zap
- Fields:
  - Goal Prompt (required)
  - Max Iterations
  - Reasoning Effort

#### **Ticket Workflow** (Blue)
- Icon: ðŸŽ« Ticket
- Fields:
  - Ticket ID (required)
  - Ticket Text
  - Summary
  - Problem Summary
  - Solution Strategy
  - Max Iterations
  - Reasoning Effort

#### **Interactive Workflow** (Green)
- Icon: ðŸ‘¥ Users
- Fields:
  - Goal Prompt (required)
  - Max Iterations
  - Reasoning Effort

### 3. Reasoning Effort Selector
- **Replaced dropdown with button group** - Three buttons (Low, Medium, High)
- **Visual feedback** - Selected button has primary color, others are gray
- **Better UX** - Easier to click, clearer options

### 4. Form State Management
- Removed `creationMode` (simple/advanced) concept
- Added `workflowType` state ('proactive' | 'ticket' | 'interactive')
- Default workflow: Proactive
- Default reasoning effort: Medium (instead of Low)
- Form resets to defaults when closed

### 5. Validation Logic
Updated `handleCreateTask` to validate based on workflow:
- **Proactive/Interactive**: Requires `goal_prompt`
- **Ticket**: Requires `ticket_id` and ticket-specific fields

### 6. API Request Structure
```typescript
// Proactive/Interactive
{
  workflow_id: 'proactive' | 'interactive',
  goal_prompt: string,
  max_iterations: number,
  reasoning_effort: string
}

// Ticket
{
  workflow_id: 'ticket',
  ticket_id: string,
  ticket_text?: string,
  summary?: string,
  problem_summary?: string,
  solution_strategy?: string,
  max_iterations: number,
  reasoning_effort: string
}
```

## Visual Improvements

### Workflow Selection Cards
- **Grid layout** - 3 columns, equal size
- **Interactive hover** - Border color changes on hover
- **Active state** - Selected workflow has colored border and background
- **Icon + Text** - Clear visual identity for each workflow
- **Subtitle** - Brief description under each workflow name

### Button Groups
- **Reasoning effort** - Row of 3 buttons instead of dropdown
- **Equal width** - Each button takes 1/3 of the container
- **Clear selection** - Active button has solid primary color
- **Smooth transitions** - Hover and click states are animated

### Layout
- **Two-column grid** for Max Iterations and Reasoning Effort
- **Spacious padding** - Better breathing room
- **Border separator** - Visual separation between form and buttons
- **Sticky header** - Title and close button stay visible

## User Experience Flow

1. **Click "New Task"** button
2. **Modal appears** with workflow selection
3. **Choose workflow type** by clicking one of the three cards
4. **Form updates** to show relevant fields for that workflow
5. **Fill in required fields** (marked with red asterisk)
6. **Adjust settings** (iterations, reasoning level)
7. **Click "Create Task"** or press Enter
8. **Modal closes** and task is created

## Code Quality

### Clean State Management
- Single source of truth for workflow type
- No mode switching (simple/advanced)
- Clear separation of workflow-specific fields

### Type Safety
- `WorkflowType` union type for workflow selection
- Proper TypeScript types for all form fields
- Type-safe API request construction

### Maintainability
- Easy to add new workflows (just add to the grid)
- Workflow-specific logic is clearly separated
- Reusable modal pattern for future forms

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Workflow Selection**
   - Verify all three workflows are selectable
   - Check that correct fields appear for each workflow
   - Ensure visual feedback (colors, borders) works

2. **Form Validation**
   - Test required field validation
   - Verify submit button enables/disables correctly
   - Test with empty, partial, and complete data

3. **Reasoning Effort Buttons**
   - Verify button selection works
   - Check that selected state persists
   - Test keyboard navigation (if needed)

4. **Modal Behavior**
   - Test opening and closing
   - Verify form reset on close
   - Check scroll behavior with long content
   - Test clicking outside modal (should close)
   - Test ESC key to close

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Verify modal fits on mobile
   - Check that workflow cards adapt to smaller screens

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add keyboard shortcuts** - ESC to close, Enter to submit
2. **Add tooltips** - Explain what each workflow type does
3. **Add preset templates** - Quick-fill common scenarios
4. **Add validation messages** - Show inline errors for invalid input
5. **Add character counters** - For text areas with limits
6. **Add save draft** - Save incomplete forms for later
